# eldritchwire_macros

This crate provides procedural macros and supporting code used internally by the main [`eldritchwire`](https://github.com/ekshore/eldritchwire) crate.

It is not intended for direct use; instead, it acts as a dependency to power macro-related features in the main `eldritchwire` library.

For most use cases, you should depend on `eldritchwire` directly.
